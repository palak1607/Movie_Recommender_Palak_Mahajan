# Movie_Recommender_App
Created an Android app which lets you know and select movies provided with their description/overview, and then recommends similar movies based on following recommendation engine created using python; HTTP calls through Flask API.   
   File: RecommendationEngine.py

This system recommends movies that are similar to a particular movie. To achieve this, it computes pairwise cosine similarity scores for all movies based on their plot descriptions and recommends movies based on that similarity score threshold.

The plot description is also available as the overview feature in the "movies_metadata" dataset.

# The project is not ready, as due to some unknown error, the app is unable to communicate properly with the API.
